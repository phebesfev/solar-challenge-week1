## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-challenge-week1.git
cd solar-challenge-week1
2. Create a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
📊 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from EnergyDataInfo.
A local copy is saved as:

bash
Copy
Edit
notebooks/senegal_raw.csv
This file is excluded from Git via .gitignore.

📒 Notebooks
senegal_eda2.ipynb:
Main notebook with:

Missing value analysis

Outlier handling

Time series visualization

Correlation studies

✅ Notebook Validation
Notebook format has been validated using the nbformat library and is compatible with GitHub's rendering engine.

Use fix_notebook.py if notebook becomes corrupted or unreadable.

🧪 GitHub Actions (CI)
Includes a GitHub Actions workflow to:

Automatically set up the Python environment

Run notebook validation and (optional) tests

🚧 Notes
Raw datasets and large files are excluded from version control.

Ensure Jupyter kernel matches the virtual environment.
